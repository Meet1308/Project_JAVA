I Create this Project with Core Java, Advanced Java and MySQL Database
There are some modules like seller, customer, admin, product, cart,  wishlist etc.
I also Used Html , CSS, JavaScript, JQuery for some Front end Work.
Seller Can Add and Maintain Their Product, Customer Can Add any Product to Wishlist and Cart and Purchase it.
I Used here JDBC API for Database Connectivity.
All Core Java Concepts like, OOPâ€™s, Exception Hendling, Basic Concepts of Java, Conditional Statements and I also used JSP and Servlet for give request to server and take response from it.
If any Customer or Seller forgot their password, then I used Google mail API integration to give OTP through email and also Used Razor pay API for Payment Gateway through which Customer can Purchase any Product.
In Last Admin Can Saw All Sellers and Customers.
